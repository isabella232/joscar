Trillian SecureIM uses Blowfish encryption with a symmetric 128-bit key negotiated over a Diffie-Hellman-based key exchange protocol.

A sample implementation of this protocol is available in the demo code included with the [joscar](http://joust.kano.net/joscar/) AIM library for Java.

This topic will be documented further later.
