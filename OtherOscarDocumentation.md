Other OSCAR documentation is available:

  * [Adam Fritzler's documentation](http://aimdoc.sourceforge.net/OSCARdoc/) (also available [here](http://www.oilcan.org/oscar/)): most detailed of all OSCAR documentation, but many parts are out of date (it was last updated in April 2000)
  * [Mark Doliner's documentation](http://kingant.net/oscar/): briefly documents some newer OSCAR features
  * [Alexandr Shutko's documentation](http://iserverd1.khstu.ru/oscar/): somewhat ICQ-specific, and the author is not a native English speaker, so it can be hard to read
  * [AOL's old Java client terminology page](http://www.aim.aol.com/javadev/terminology.html): not very useful
  * [Rï¿½diger Kuhlmann and Douglas McLaughlin's ICQ documentation](http://www.stud.uni-karlsruhe.de/~uck4/ICQ/): very ICQ-specific, somewhat hard to read
