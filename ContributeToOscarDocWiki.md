As all Wikis are, the Oscar Documentation Wiki is editable by anyone who visits the page; anyone who wants to contribute is free to do so.

Contributors should follow the OscarDocWikiStandards. Anyone who contributes should create a HomePage (like KeithLea and DavidWalluck) describing themselves.

''Old stuff:''

Couldn't you just subscribe to all the pages of the wiki instead? If someone is making a lot of changes, it'll be tedious to go over everything again (and the RecentChanges page lists recent changes done by contributers). --BrianChu

Yeah, that's fine. --KeithLea
